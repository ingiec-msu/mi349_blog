        <h2>Mapping Out My Future</h2>
        <h3>Author: Ingie Charles</h3>
        <h3>Published: 9/27/2025</h3>
        <p>As graduation approaches, I’ve started thinking seriously about where I want to spend my twenties — both for life and for my career. While I’m open to unexpected opportunities, I’ve narrowed down a few countries and cities that I’m most drawn to.</p>
        
        <h4>Seoul, Korea</h4>

        <p>Pros: I’m minoring in Korean and studied abroad here last fall. I love the food, public transport, and endless things to do.</p>
        <p>Cons: It’s harder to find English-dominant jobs, and many foreigners don’t stay long-term, which can make lasting friendships difficult.</p>
        
        <h4>Austin, Texas</h4>

        <p>Pros: It’s close enough to visit family across states, and housing is affordable.</p>
        <p>Cons: The heat is intense, there’s no reliable public transportation, and the bugs are huge.</p>
        
        <h4>London, United Kingdom</h4>

        <p>Pros: I’ve always wanted to visit Europe, and London’s architecture is stunning.</p>
        <p>Cons: The lack of sunlight and cold weather would take getting used to.</p>
        
        <h4>Shanghai, China</h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Shanghai_skyline_2018%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="City of Shanghai, China" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <p>Pros: I’ve been before and loved it — great public transport, beautiful city views, and easy access to nearby countries.</p>
        <p>Cons: Internet censorship would be challenging.</p>

        <h4>Atlanta, Georgia</h4>
        <img src="https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/06/atlanta-best-workplaces-list-inc-GettyImages-2153254743.jpg" alt="City of Atlanta, Georgia" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <p>Pros: A comfortable place to settle down later in life, with amazing food options.</p>
        <p>Cons: Housing costs are high.</p>

        <h2>A Gentle Reset: Building Habits That Last</h2>
        <h3>Author: Ingie Charles</h3>
        <h3>Published: 9/27/2025</h3>

        <p>Lately, I’ve been focusing on improving my health — both in how I eat and how I move. Since this is my final year at Michigan State University, I want to end it on a strong and healthy note by building habits that will carry into adulthood. I’ve failed at this goal before, but this time I’m setting clear, realistic rules to stay consistent: follow the 80/20 rule, train each body group twice a week, get seven hours of sleep, and practice self-forgiveness.</p>

        <h4>Follow the 80/20 rule</h4>
        <img src="https://pin.it/3hV4rUY8B" alt="Assorted vegestables and fruits" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <p>I still want to enjoy my favorite foods, so the 80/20 rule helps me stay balanced. Eighty percent of the time, I’ll focus on eating nutritious, protein-rich meals. The other 20 percent, I’ll enjoy the foods I love without guilt.</p>

        <h4>Train each body group twice a week</h4>
        <img src="url" alt="">
        <p>To reach the form I want, I plan to work both my upper and lower body twice a week using targeted exercises. I’ve created a workout chart to help me stay consistent and track my progress.To reach the form I want, I plan to work both my upper and lower body twice a week using targeted exercises.

        <h4>Get at least seven hours of sleep</h4>
        <img src="https://pin.it/1IscCVs6h" alt="Sleeping mask" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
        <p>Proper rest is essential — muscles recover and grow during sleep, so I’m making it a priority.</p>

        <h4>Practice self-forgiveness</h4>
        <img src="url" alt="">
        <p>If I slip up or miss a workout, I won’t give up. Instead, I’ll forgive myself, learn from it, and try again the next day. Consistency, not perfection, is what matters most.</p>

        <p>This time, I’m not chasing quick results because I’m building habits that last.</p>
