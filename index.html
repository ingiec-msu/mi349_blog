        <h2>Mapping Out My Future</h2>
        <h3>Author: Ingie Charles</h3>
        <h3>Published: 9/27/2025</h3>
        <p>As graduation approaches, I’ve started thinking seriously about where I want to spend my twenties — both for life and for my career. While I’m open to unexpected opportunities, I’ve narrowed down a few countries and cities that I’m most drawn to.</p>
        
        <h3>Seoul, Korea</h3>
        <p>Pros: I’m minoring in Korean and studied abroad here last fall. I love the food, public transport, and endless things to do.</p>
        <p>Cons: It’s harder to find English-dominant jobs, and many foreigners don’t stay long-term, which can make lasting friendships difficult.</p>
        
        <h3>Austin, Texas</h3>
        <p>Pros: It’s close enough to visit family across states, and housing is affordable.</p>
        <p>Cons: The heat is intense, there’s no reliable public transportation, and the bugs are huge.</p>
        
        <h3>London, United Kingdom</h3>
        <p>Pros: I’ve always wanted to visit Europe, and London’s architecture is stunning.</p>
        <p>Cons: The lack of sunlight and cold weather would take getting used to.</p>
        
        <h3>Shanghai, China</h3>
        <p>Pros: I’ve been before and loved it — great public transport, beautiful city views, and easy access to nearby countries.</p>
        <p>Cons: Internet censorship would be challenging.</p>

        <h3>Atlanta, Georgia</h3>
        <p>Pros: A comfortable place to settle down later in life, with amazing food options.</p>
        <p>Cons: Housing costs are high.</p>
