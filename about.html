<!-- Bio Text -->
 <p>Hello! My name is Ingie Charles. I’m a proud Haitian-American from Florida, and I’m currently in my fifth and final year at Michigan State University. My journey at MSU has been filled with moments of growth, reflection, and purpose. Each experience has helped me better understand who I am and where I want to go next.</p>
 <p>I’m majoring in Information Science and minoring in Korean, which perfectly reflects my passion for technology and culture. Through my studies, I’ve learned how information connects people and influences how we view the world. I enjoy exploring how data and design can solve real-world problems. My ultimate goal is to become a project manager who leads with creativity, empathy, and collaboration.</p>
 <p>After graduation, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a master’s degree abroad. I hope to study in either South Korea or China, as both countries inspire me with their innovation and cultural richness. I believe immersing myself in a global learning environment will help me grow professionally and personally. My dream is to gain a perspective that allows me to lead projects across diverse teams and communities.</p>
 <p>When I’m not planning my next step, I like to take time to relax and enjoy my favorite hobbies. I love putting together jigsaw puzzles and learning new dance routines at the studio. In my downtime, you’ll often find me watching King of the Hill in my dorm room. These small joys keep me grounded, balanced, and motivated as I move toward my goals.</p>
 <p>My main goals, which I’ll be posting about often, are the following:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way.</li>
  <li>Improving my overall health and well-being.</li>
  <li>Strengthening my Korean language skills.</li>
  <li>Finishing the school year strong, both academically and personally.</li>
</ul>
